= Bugs and Issues Found on Dec 1 Debugging Session =

URGENT: 
Page: Auction Details Page
Function requirement F14 states that closed auctions can be re-opened by the owner but right now if you close the auction, it cannot be accessed by the user anymore. (does not show up on manage auction)


URGENT:
Page: View All Auctions
Auction list does not refresh automatically like we said it was supposed to
-maybe add an auto refresh similar to what would happen after clicking bid


Type: Bug
Page: Manage Auction/View Details
-This only seems to affect some of the old created auctions (house s1, testtest)
Closing an expired auction does not change its status from expired to closed under the Status column in the Auction List Table. (Auction status changes to closed in the details page ) Due to this it is possible to "Change Auction Status" to close and then access the auction again from Manage Auction and still be able to close the auction again from "Owner Option: Change Auction Status"
(Tested with test1 - trying to close "testtest")


Type: Bug
Condition: logged in or not
Page: Auction List
Delete auction button under auction list page generates 
javascript error and does nothing. This should not even be 
there (take check box away)


Type: Defect
"Search People" does not work, maybe remove the link out of the right-side menu
Type: Issue
Page: Auction Details
User should not be able to add themselves as a friend

Type: Defect
